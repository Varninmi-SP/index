    <h2>My Past</h2>
    <p>
      Ever since I was young, I was curious about how computers worked. I spent hours exploring software, fixing issues, and learning how systems function. That passion led me to dive into computer basics, coding, and hardware. I became the go-to person for solving tech problems around me. My early journey with computers built a strong foundation that sparked my interest in design and web development, shaping the creative path I follow today.

      Currently, I’m focused on building my skills as a graphics designer. I enjoy creating visual content that communicates ideas clearly and creatively. From logos to social media designs, I love bringing concepts to life using tools like Photoshop and Canva. Every project is a chance to improve and explore new styles. Design isn’t just my passion—it’s how I express myself and connect with people through visuals that make an impact.
